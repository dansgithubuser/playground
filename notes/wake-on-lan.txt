Make sure you have the _right_ BIOS setting enabled. Is it a built-in network interface or plugged into a PCIe?

OS needs configuration too. On Linux:
- `sudo vi /etc/netplan/<whatever seems right>.yaml` and make sure network.ethernets.<interface name>.wakeonlan is set to true.
- `sudo netplan apply`
- `sudo ethtool <interface name>` and check for `Wake-on: g`

You can install `wakeonlan` on Linux. Specifying just a MAC address (example: `11:22:33:AA:BB:CC`) should work if sender and WOLer are connected to same router.
