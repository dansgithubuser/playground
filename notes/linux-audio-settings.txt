# How to set default volume for a device:
## `acpi_listen` and plug/unplug the device
	- let's say we are interested in `jack/headphone HEADPHONE plug`

## write a script in `/etc/acpi/`
Have a look through `amixer scontrols`.

`/etc/acpi/headphone-set-mic-vol.sh`
```
sleep 1
amixer set Capture 100%
amixer set 'Mic Boost' 33%
```

## put a file in `/etc/acpi/events/`
`/etc/acpi/events/headphone-plugged`
```
event=jack/microphone MICROPHONE plug
action=/bin/su -c /etc/acpi/headphone-set-mic-vol.sh - dan
```
