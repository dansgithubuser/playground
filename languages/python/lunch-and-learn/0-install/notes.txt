`python --version` to figure out what version you have.
If you have version 2, try `python3 --version`.
If you don't have Python 3, you don't have Python.
If you are on Linux and already have Python, be careful how you install -- prefer using pyenv.
We'll be using 3.7 because it's _stable_ and _new_.
