goals:
	sign in to ror app with azure
		ror auth gem: devise
	enumerate users in an Azure Active Directory

auth protocols that azure supports?
	SAML - some empirical evidence this is the correct choice
	oauth2 - deals with authorization, but we only want authentication
	LDAP (lightweight directory access protocol) - only for directories?
